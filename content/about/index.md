Hello World! My name is Akshay Kanthi. 

I currently live in Bangalore, India. Welcome! 

I plan to document some of my ideas



Hello, my name is Song Wang.

I am a full-stack software engineer at [TuSimple](http://www.tusimple.com/), living in ~~Beijing~~, ~~Chengdu~~, ~~Yokohama~~, ~~New York~~, San Diego.

I code Javascript, Python and Go; I'm also digging Lua, Vim Script.

I love open source, and I contribute from [my Github](https://github.com/wangsongiam/) as a hobby.

I am a [top 5% fastest](https://www.keyhero.com/profile/user67157/) typist in the world.

## About songwang.io

This is my blog site, with a focus on simplicity and performance. It was built with Jekyll and got migrated to Gatsby. It's also coded in the functional paradigm and fully [open sourced](https://github.com/wangsongiam/songwang.io).

While the site is about expressing myself through words, the UI and codes are also carrying my reflections.
